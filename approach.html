            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>
                At L.I.G Vault, we facilitate special situation investments, and directly purchase shares in mature and news. 
                Our flexibility and creativity allow us to craft solutions for every scenario — from straightforward deals to the most complex investment structures.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are committed to empowering small and emerging businesses by providing essential investment and funding support. 
                By partnering closely with these companies, we help them scale, innovate, and create sustainable growth that shapes the future of their industries and communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our investment strategy is designed for balance and impact: 70% of our portfolio targets stable, reliable “boring” investments, 
                15% focuses on high-risk, high-reward opportunities, and 15% is allocated to emerging markets with strong growth potential. 
                This disciplined approach ensures long-term stability while capturing the upside of innovation and new market frontiers.
